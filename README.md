# Cinema API - Backend

This API manages the information for a frontend application for a user to select a movie, a cinena, and finally booking a seat to see a movie.

# Progress

For the creation of the backend code I will be creating each of the endpoint for CRUD operations in each table. Meanwhile for every endpoint I will be switching to the frontend UI to handle that endpoint.

## Cinema table

1. I will create a table to save the name of each cinema.
2. cinema.routes create to write CRUD logic for each controller
3. (x) create a cinema endpoint - done
4. (x) get all cinemas endpoint - done
5. (x) update a cinema name - done
6. (x) delete a cinema - done
7. (x) filter cinemas by name - done
